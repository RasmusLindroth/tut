# Timelines adds windows of feeds. You can customize the number of feeds, what

# The one named special are the home timeline with only boosts and/or replies.

# Tag is special as you need to add the tag after, see the example below.
# 
# The syntax is:
# timelines=feed,[name],[keys...],[showBoosts],[showReplies]
# 
# Tha values in brackets are optional. You can see the syntax for keys under the
# [input] section.
# 
# showBoosts and showReplies must be formated as bools. So either true or false.
# They always defaults to true.
# 
# Some examples:
# 
# home timeline with the name Home
# timelines=home,Home
# 
# local timeline with the name Local and it gets focus when you press 2. It will
# also hide boosts in the timeline, but show toots that are replies.

# The value is an integear
# -1     = don't use relative dates
#  0     = always use relative dates, except for dates < 1 day
#  1 - âˆž = number of days to use relative dates

# The leader is used as a shortcut to run commands as you can do in Vim. By

# only consist of one char and I like to use comma as leader key. So to set it
# you write leader-key=,
# default=
leader-key=

# Number of milliseconds before the leader command resets. So if you tap the
# leader-key by mistake or are to slow it empties all the input after X
# milliseconds.
# default=1000
leader-timeout=1000

# You set actions for the leader-key with one or more leader-action. It consists
# of two parts first the action then the shortcut. And they're separated by a
# comma.
#

# The ones named special-* are the home timeline with only boosts and/or
# replies. All contains both, -boosts only boosts and -replies only replies.
# 
# The shortcuts are up to you, but keep them quite short and make sure they
# don't collide. If you have one shortcut that is "f" and an other one that is
# "fav", the one with "f" will always run and "fav" will never run. 
# 
# Some special leaders:
# tag is special as you need to add the tag after, e.g. tag linux
# window is special as it's a shortcut for switching between the timelines
# you've set under general and they are zero indexed. window 0 = your first
# timeline, window 1 = your second and so on.
# list-placement as it takes the argument top, right, bottom or left
# list-split as it takes the argument column or row
# proportions takes the arguments [int] [int], where the first integer is the
# list and the other content, e.g. proportions 1 3. See list-proportion above
# for more information.
# switch let's you go to a timeline if it already exists, if it doesn't it will
# open the timeline in a new window. The syntax is almost the same as in
# timelines= and is displayed under the examples.

[open-pattern]
# Here you can set your own glob patterns for opening matching URLs in the

# in your video player instead of your default browser.
# 
# You must name the keys foo-pattern, foo-use and foo-terminal, where use is the
# program that will open up the URL. To see the syntax for glob pattern you can
# follow this URL https://github.com/gobwas/glob#syntax. foo-terminal is if the
# program runs in the terminal and should open in the same terminal as tut
# itself.
# 
# Example for youtube.com and youtu.be to open up in mpv instead of the browser.

[style]
# All styles can be represented in their HEX value like #ffffff or with their
# name, so in this case white. The only special value is "default" which equals
# to transparent, so it will be the same color as your terminal.
# 
# You can also use xrdb colors like this xrdb:color1 The program will use colors
# prefixed with an * first then look for URxvt or XTerm if it can't find any
# color prefixed with an asterisk. If you don't want tut to guess the prefix you
# can set the prefix yourself. If the xrdb color can't be found a preset color
# will be used. You'll have to set theme=none for this to work.

# You can use some themes that comes bundled with tut. Check out the themes

[input]
# You can edit the keys for tut below.
# 
# The syntax is a bit weird, but it works. And I'll try to explain it as well as
# I can.
# 
# Example:
# status-favorite="[F]avorite","Un[F]avorite",'f','F'
# status-delete="[D]elete",'d','D'
# 
# status-favorite and status-delete differs because favorite can be in two
# states, so you will have to add two key hints.
# Most keys will only have on key hint. Look at the default value for reference.
# 
# Key hints must be in some of the following formats. Remember the quotation
# marks.
# "" = empty
# "[D]elete" = Delete with a highlighted D
# "Un[F]ollow" = UnFollow with a highlighted F
# "[Enter]" = Enter where everything is highlighted
# "Yan[K]" = YanK with a highlighted K
# 
# After the hint (or hints) you must set the keys. You can do this in two ways,
# with single quotation marks or double ones.
# 
# The single ones are for single chars like 'a', 'b', 'c' and double marks are
# for special keys like "Enter". Remember that they are case sensitive.
# 
# To find the names of special keys you have to go to the following site and
# look for "var KeyNames = map[Key]string{"
#
