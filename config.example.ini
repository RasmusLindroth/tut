[open-pattern]
# Here you can set your own glob patterns for opening matching URLs in the
# program you want them to open up in.
# You could for example open Youtube videos in your video player instead of
# your default browser.
#
# You must name the keys foo-pattern and foo-use, where use is the program 
# that will open up the URL. To see the syntax for glob pattern you can follow
# this URL https://github.com/gobwas/glob#syntax
#
# Example for youtube.com and youtu.be to open up in mpv instead of the browser
#
# y1-pattern=*youtube.com/watch*
# y1-use=mpv
# y2-pattern=*youtu.be/*
# y2-use=mpv

[style]
# All styles can be represented in their HEX value like #ffffff or
# with their name, so in this case white.
# The only special value is "default" which equals to transparent,
# so it will be the same color as your terminal. But this can lead
# to some artifacts left from a previous paint

# You can also use xrdb colors like this xrdb:color1
# The program will use colors prefixed with an * first then look
# for URxvt or XTerm if it can't find any color prefixed with an asterik.
# If you don't want tut to guess the prefix you can set the prefix yourself.
# If the xrdb color can't be found a preset color will be used.
