# NAME
tut - configuration for tut(1)

# DESCRIPTION
The configuration format for tut.

You find it in *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tut/config.toml* on Linux which usually equals to *~/.config/tut/config.toml*.
If you don't run Linux it will use the path of the Go funcdtion os.UserConfigDir().
But if you move the tut folder to *XDG_CONFIG_HOME/tut/* and have set the environment variable *XDG_CONFIG_HOME*
it will look there instead of the standard place.

# CONFIGURATION
The configuration file is divided in seven sections named general, media, open-custom, open-pattern, desktop-notification, style and input.

Under each section there is the name of the configuration option. The last line under each options shows the default value. 

# GENERAL
This section is \[general\] in your configuration file

The shortcuts are up to you, but keep them quite short and make sure they don\'t collide. If you have one shortcut that is \"f\" and an other one that is \"fav\", the one with \"f\" will always run and \"fav\" will never run.   
  
Some special actions that requires data to be set:  
pane is special as it\'s a shortcut for switching between the panes you\'ve set under general and they are zero indexed. pane 0 = your first timeline, pane 1 = your second and so on.  
list-placement as it takes the argument top, right, bottom or left  
list-split as it takes the argument column or row  
proportions takes the arguments \[int\] \[int\], where the first integer is the list and the other content, e.g. proportions 1 3. See list-proportion above for more information.

\[\[general.leader-actions\]\]  
type=\"close-pane\"  
shortcut=\"q\"  
  
\[\[general.leader-actions\]\]  
type=\"list-split\"  
data=\"row\"

# INPUT
This section is \[input\] in your configuration file

In this section you set the keys to be used in tut.  
		  
The hint option lets you set which part of the hint that will be highlighted in tut. E.g. \[F\]avorite results in a highlighted F and the rest of the text is displayed normaly.  
Some of the options can be in two states, like favorites, so there you can set the hint-alt option to something like Un\[F\]avorite.  
  
Examples:  
\"\[D\]elete\" = Delete with a highlighted D  
\"Un\[F\]ollow\" = UnFollow with a highlighted F  
\"\[Enter\]\" = Enter where everything is highlighted  
\"Yan\[K\]\" = YanK with a highlighted K  
  
The keys option lets you define what key that should be pressed. This is limited to on character only and they are case sensetive.  
Example:  
keys=\[\"j\",\"J\"\]  
  
You can also set special-keys and they\'re for keys like Escape and Enter. To find the names of special keys you have to go to the following site and look for \"var KeyNames = map\[Key\]string{\"
